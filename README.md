# Caduceus

In Greek and Roman mythology, [caduceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus) was the wand used by Hermes (Mercury): the god of financial gain, commerce, eloquence, messages, communication, travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves.  Caduceus was given to Hermes by Apollo as a gesture of friendship between the two gods, and over time it has come to represent commerce and negotiation; two realms in which balanced exchange and reciprocity are recognized as ideals.  

In international commerce, balanced exchanges and reciprocity are the cornerstone of modern banking.  One of the ways that these foundations are encoded is through the [International Bank Account Number (IBAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) system, which is an international standard for identifying bank accounts across borders.  Through IBAN, banks across the world have the power to send money to each other and ensure that the money is going to the correct place.  

However, as with many international standards, IBANs can be complex, and verifying the correctness of these IBANs during financial transactions is a critical part to making sure the money goes where it needs to.  This is where caduceus comes in: this library is intended to help Haskellers validate and parse IBAN codes in a lightweight way so that they can write business logic without worrying about if the IBANs that they're dealing with are correct.  Just as Hermes used caduceus to facilitate transactions in mythology, so too will caduceus help software engineers build resilient services for doing international commerce.
